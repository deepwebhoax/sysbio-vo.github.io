      short_description: We present a global atlas of 4,728 metagenomic samples from mass-transit systems in
        60 cities over 3 years, representing the first systematic, worldwide catalog of the urban microbial
        ecosystem. This atlas provides an annotated, geospatial profile of microbial strains, functional characteristics,
        antimicrobial resistance (AMR) markers, and genetic elements, including 10,928 viruses, 1,302 bacteria, 2 archaea,
        and 838,532 CRISPR arrays not found in reference databases.

        A new insight into mechanisms of interferon alpha neurotoxicity: Expression of GRIN3A subunit of NMDA

      short_description: The molecular mechanisms of interferon α neurotoxicity during the high-dose therapy are unknown.
        By bioinformatics approach, we predicted the gene Grin3α as a new potential target gene of IFNA.
        IFNA intracranial administration increased Grin3a expression and classical IFNA-target genes in the mouse brain.
        IFNA induces increased NMDA-evoked neurotransmitters release and does not affect neurotransmitters accumulation.

      short_description: We discuss here the case for a Pediatric Cell Atlas as part of the Human Cell Atlas
        consortium to provide single-cell profiles and spatial characterization of gene expression across human
        tissues and organs. Such data will complement adult and developmentally focused HCA projects to provide
        a rich cytogenomic framework for understanding not only pediatric health and disease but also environmental
        and genetic impacts across the human lifespan.

      bibtex: sysbio.org.ua/research/publications/korneeva2016.bib
      short_description: In the present paper we propose parallelized algorithm designed for multi-core and distributed
        systems and its implementation in the improved version of BNFinder—tool for learning optimal Bayesian networks.
        Our benchmarking results on realistic datasets indicate that the tool should be useful to a wide audience of
        researchers interested in discovering dependencies in their large-scale transcriptomic datasets.

      short_description: Cost- and time-effective HPLC/MS method was developed for analysis of SAM and SAH concentration
        in human placenta. The concentration of SAM and SAH depends on the concentration of homocysteine and amino acids
        cirtical for one carbon metabolism. The fraction of each methyltransferase maximal velocity depends on its MIchaelis
        constant and SAM and SAH concentration.

      short_description: The first laboratory of Systems Biology in Ukraine (IMBIG NASU) represents a track record of its
        scientific results. They include the pioneered development of a web-based tool for genome-wide surveys of eukaryotic
        promoters for the presence of transcription factors binding sites (COTRASIF); the deciphered mechanisms of the fine-tuned
        and balanced response of primary hepatocytes to interferon alpha levels recorded after partial hepatectomy; the elaboration
        of a novel method of gene regulatory network inference compatible with GRID environment and the development of a stoichiometric
        model of folate-related one carbon unit metabolism in human placenta and its application for the characteristics of the system’s
        behavior as a whole at different human pathologies.
