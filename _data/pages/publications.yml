      short_description: The cellular cysteine is highly regulated in a narrow range of
        concentrations due to its cyto- and neurtoxicity when it is overwhelmed or its
        deficiency for protein synthesis and other vital metabolic reactions when its
        amount is restricted

      short_description: Our recent studies have revealed the early up-regulated expression
        of interferon alpha (IFNα) in the liver, induced by partial hepatectomy. The role
        of this cytokine of innate immune response in liver regeneration is still controversial

      short_description: Bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical models widely used
        to infer interactions between biological entities such as genes orproteins. In
        general, learning Bayesian networks from experimental data is NP-hard, leading
        to widespread use of heuristic search methods giving suboptimal results.
